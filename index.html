<h1>I am Daniel Petersen</h1>
<p>I'm a Freshman Information Technology major at Bob Jones University.
            Some people might consider this a very "nerdy" major.... and they would
            be very right.
         </p>
         <p>
            I was born and raised as a missionary kid in the country of Poland, which
            gave me a bit of a unique perspective on life compared to the average 
            American teenager. But despite my differences with other guys around campus
            I can still get along with most people fairly well.
         </p> 
         <p>
            In what little spare time I do have, I quite enjoy walking around campus
            and just taking photos. Photography is a passion of mine, that I'd quite
            like to pursue as a possible profession in the future.
